- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- One Player is X and the other is O. 
- Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- Additionally, Players can jump back to a previous move if they want to.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
